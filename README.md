## Outline
*This project is compatible with mobile, tablet and desktop*

This calculator works by pushing each button's assigned value to an array. The user's input is first checked as valid. If valid, the equation is calculated and displayed on the screen.

Note: This calculator was first made using the eval() method. Having learned of the security flaws in using eval(), I rebuilt the calculator using number methods and without the use of eval().

## Technologies
I made this calculator using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
