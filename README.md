## Outline
*This project is compatible with mobile, tablet and desktop*

This is my first calculator build. It works by pushing a button's innerHTML to a string. Through JS rules, this string must be in the form numbervalue, operator, numbervalue and so on. This string is sent as the input to a calculateValue function, which will calculator the screen output.
NOTE: This calculator was first made using the eval() method. Having learned of the security flaws in using eval(), I have rebuilt the calculator using number methods and without the use of eval().

## Technologies
I made this calculator using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
