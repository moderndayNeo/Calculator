## Outline
This is my first calculator build. It works by pushing a button's innerHTML to a string, to be evaluated when the user clicks equals.
NOTE: This calculator was made using the eval() method. Having learned of the security flaws in using the eval() method as a developer, I have rebuilt the calculator returning numbers instead of a string, and without the use of eval().

## Technologies
I made this calculator using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
